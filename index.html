      the rat scholars inc. is not a real organization. what filler text should i put right here? maybe some random cat facts? nah that's boring. hmmm maybe uncle chris will read this. in that case, hi uncle chris! thanks for generously helping us with this. alright i think that's enough filler text. maybe a couple more words. rat rat rat rat rat rat rat. alright now it's good.
